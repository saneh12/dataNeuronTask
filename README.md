# Semantic Textual Similarity between two texts
This API will take two texts as input and give the degree to which two sentences are 
semantically equivalent to each other.
1 means highly similar 
0 means highly dissimilar
Request body: {“text1”: ”nuclear body seeks new tech .......”, ”text2”: ”terror suspects face arrest ......”} 
Response body: {“similarity score”: 0.2 }

A brief description about the project: 
• Used distil Roberta model from sentence transformers to create the embeddings of textual 
data.
• This model is very suitable for semantic analysis.
• After getting the embeddings we can apply cosine similarity to check the similarity between 
two pairs of text vectors.

Some examples of how this API works :
